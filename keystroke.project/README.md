# Keystroke Monitoring Component

## Overview
This module implements ethical keystroke monitoring capabilities for educational and security awareness purposes. It demonstrates how keystroke logging works to help security professionals understand potential vulnerabilities and protect against malicious keyloggers.

## Educational Purpose
This code is provided for **educational purposes only** to demonstrate:
- How keystroke monitoring can be implemented
- Security vulnerabilities related to keyboard input
- Methods of detecting keyloggers

## Features
- Low-level keyboard event capture
- Secure logging of keystrokes with encryption
- Detection evasion techniques analysis
- Cross-platform implementation

## Ethical Usage Guidelines
This tool should only be used:
- On your own systems
- With explicit permission
- For legitimate security research
- In accordance with local laws and regulations

## Technical Implementation
The implementation uses Python's keyboard library to capture input events. All captured data is immediately encrypted using the same security standards as the main password manager.

## Usage Example
```python
from keystroke_monitor import KeystrokeMonitor

# Initialize with encryption key
monitor = KeystrokeMonitor(encryption_key)

# Start monitoring with consent
monitor.start_with_consent()

# Later, stop monitoring
monitor.stop()

# Get encrypted report
report = monitor.get_encrypted_report()
